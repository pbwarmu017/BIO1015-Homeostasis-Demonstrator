JP, 

I think we are the point that we can order components for this, and I can start putting these kits together with the two affectors that I have designed. In the future we can add additional affectors to this.  I am using the 3D printing filament and what parts that you've already purchased. This order will get me to the point that I can manufacture 6 kits with two affectors each. 

Here is the list, with quantity:

We also will need to place an order for the circuit boards with OshPark on Monday, if you are ready to do so. I will show you how to go about it during my office hours, I have the files ready. The boards are going to run around $90 in total. 

I'm curious how much this comes to in total. I imagine we are looking at over $300 before shipping.
